The Filecoin virtual machine (FVM) is a runtime environment for smart contracts on the Filecoin network, responsible for executing and securing them. These smart contracts, also called actors, can be written in Solidity or any language that compiles to WASM.

We created the FVM to enable developers to build new use cases on top of the Filecoin network, such as data access control, data DAOs, perpetual storage, loans, and Ethereum-compatible fungible and non-fungible tokens. To deliver a quality developer experience, we delayed development until the Filecoin network was stable, robust, and secure.

Data access control: The FVM allows Filecoin network participants to limit individual data access, an advantage previously only available using centralized storage solutions.

Data DAO: FVM data access control enables the creation and management of data centered decentralized-autonomous-organizations, which can govern and monetize data access and pool returns into a shared treasury.

Perpetual storage: The FVM allows users to store data permanently, managed by repair and replication bots, which also benefit from Filecoinâ€™s verifiable storage proofs.

Loans: FIL token holders can use their holdings to provide storage collateral and receive interest, and community-generated reputation scores enable everyone to identify good borrowers.

Ethereum compatibility: The FVM is fully EVM-compatible, allowing new ERC-20 tokens to be launched on the Filecoin network and enabling layer two networks to leverage its storage power and security.

## FVM Uses-cases

The FVM is a crucial component of the Filecoin network that enables the development of new use cases on top of it, such as data access control, data DAOs, perpetual storage, loans, and Ethereum compatibility. FVM development is now possible as the Filecoin network is stable, robust, and secure.
