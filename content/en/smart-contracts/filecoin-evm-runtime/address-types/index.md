In the Filecoin network, an *address* is a unique identifier that refers to an actor in the Filecoin state. All actors (user account actors, miner actors, actors, etc.) in Filecoin have a corresponding address which varies from the different usages.

The goal of using different types of addresses is to provide a robust address format that is easy and reliable to use, scalable and resistant. These addresses encode information includingï¼š

- network prefix - indicates the network the actor belongs to.
- protocol indicator - identify the type and version of this address.
- payload - identify the actor according to the protocol.
- checksum - validate the address.

They are two ways a Filecoin address can be represented: raw bytes and string. Raw bytes format will be always used on-chain. An address can be also encoded to a string including a checksum and network prefix. The string format will never appear on-chain, but only for human readable purposes. 

The Filecoin address can be breakdown like the following.

| network prefix | protocol indicator                  | payload | checksum |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `f` / `t`      | 1 byte: `0` / `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` | n bytes | 4 bytes  |

**Network Prefix**

The network prefix is prepended to an address when encoding to a string. The network prefix indicates which network an address belongs to. It is worth noting that a network prefix will never appear on-chain and is only used when encoding an address to a human-readable format.

- `f` - addresses for Filecoin MainNet.
- `t` - addresses used in Filecoin TestNet, including Calibration and Hyperspace.

**Protocol Indicator**

The protocol indicator identifies the address type which describes how a method should interpret the information in the payload field of an address. 

+ `0` - An ID address.
+ `1` - Wallet address generated from secp256k public key.
+ `2` - Actor address.
+ `3` - Wallet address generated from BLS public key.
+ `4` - delegated address for user-defined foreign actors.
  + `410` - Ethereum compatible address space managed by Ethereum Address Manager(EAM).

Each of the address types is described below.

## 0 - ID Addresses

All addresses have a short integer assigned to them by `InitActor`, a unique actor that can create _new_ actors. This integer that gets assigned is the ID of that actor. An _ID address_ is an actor's ID prefixed with the network identifier and the protocol indicator. Therefore, any address in the Filecoin network has a unique ID address assigned to it.

#### Example

The MainNet burn account ID address, `f099`, is structured as follows:

```plaintext
  Protocol Indicator
  |
f 0 9 9
|    |
|    Actor ID
Network identifier
```

## 2 - Actor Addresses

Addressed representing an Actor in the Filecoin network. It provides a way to create robust addresses for actors not associated with a public key. They are generated by taking a `sha256` hash of the output of the account creation. 

Actor addresses are often referred to by their shorthand, `2`.

## 1/3 - Wallet Addresses

Addresses managed directly by users, like accounts, are derived from a public-private key pair. If you have access to a private key, you can sign messages sent from that wallet address. The public key is used to derive an address for the actor. Public key addresses are referred to as _robust addresses_ as they do not depend on the Filecoin chain state.

Public key addresses allow devices, like hardware wallets, to derive a valid Filecoin address for your account using just the public key. The device doesn't need to ask a remote node what your ID address is. Public key addresses provide a concise, safe, human-readable way to reference actors before the chain state is final. ID addresses are a space-efficient way to identify actors in the Filecoin chain state, where every byte matters.

Filecoin supports two types of public key addresses:

- [secp256k1 addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) that begin with the protocol indicator as `1`.
- [BLS addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) that begin with the protocol indicator as `3`.

#### Example

`t1iandfn6d...ddboqxbhoeva` - a TestNet wallet address generated using secp256k1. 

`t3vxj34sbdr3...road7cbygq` - a TestNet wallet address generated using BLS.

## 4 - Delegated Addresses

Filecoin supports extensible, user-defined actor addresses through the `4` address class, introduced in [fip-0048](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0048.md). The `4` address class provides the following benefits to the network:

- Implement foreign addressing systems (e.g., the one used in Ethereum) in Filecoin.
- A predictable addressing scheme to support interactions with addresses that do not yet exist on-chain.
- User-defined, custom addressing systems without extensive changes and network upgrades.

A `4` address is structured as `f/t 4 <address-manager-actor-id> <new-actor-id>`, where

-  `<address-manager-actor-id>` is the actor ID of the _address manager actor_ which creates new actors and assigns a `4` address to the new actor. This leverage the extensible feature of f4 address class. For instance, `10` is the actor ID for Ethereum Address Manager (EAM) built-in actor.
-  `<new-actor-id>` is the arbitrary actor ID chosen by that actor.

**Note**

Currently, per [fip-0048](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0048.md), `f4` addresses may only be assigned by and in association with specific, built-in actors called _address managers_. Once users are able to deploy custom WebAssembly actors, this restriction will likely be relaxed, in a future FIP.

This address type plays a very essential role in supporting the EVM-compatible FVM. It allows the Filecoin network to be able to recognize the foreign address and validate and execute the transactions sent and signed by the supported foreign addresses.

**Note**

The supported foreign addresses can be cast as `f4/t4` addresses, and vice-versa.  But not with `f1/t1` or `f3/t3` addresses.

### Ethereum Address Manager (EAM)

Ethereum Address Manager (EAM) is a built-in actor which manages the Ethereum address space, anchored at the `410` address namespace. It acts like an EVM smart contract factory, offering methods to create and assign the `f410/t410` Filecoin address to Ethereum address. 

The subaddress of an `f410/t410` address is the original Ethereum address. Ethereum addresses can be cast as `f410` addresses, and vice-versa. The `f410/t410` address will be used for the Ethereum-compatible FVM (FEVM) development tools and applications built on FEVM.

#### Example

```
//The Ethereum wallet address
0xd388ab098ed3e84c0d808776440b48f685198498

//The corresponding Filecoin address on hyperspace
t410f2oekwcmo2pueydmaq53eic2i62crtbeyuzx2gmy
```

Assume you have an Ethereum wallet address starting with `0x` , then the Ethereum Address Manager (EAM) will assign a corresponding `t410` Filecoin address to it. 

When you send 10 TFIL to `0xd388ab098ed3e84c0d808776440b48f685198498` address using MetaMask, you will receive 10 TFIL to your `t410f2oekwcmo2pueydmaq53eic2i62crtbeyuzx2gmy` address on Filecoin Hyperspace TestNet.

```
//The Filecoin smart contract address
t410fl5qeigmkcytz7b6sqoojtcetqwf37dm4zv4aijq

//The corresponding Ethereum smart contract address
0x5f6044198a16279f87d2839c998893858bbf8d9c
```

Again, assume you have deployed a solidity smart contract on Filecoin Hyperspace. Then you will receive a smart contract address starting with `t410`. EAM will also assign a corresponding `0x` Ethereum address to it.

When you try to invoke this smart contract on Filecoin using Ethereum toolings, you need to use your `0x5f6044198a16279f87d2839c998893858bbf8d9c` smart contract address.
